    <h2>Welcome to the Okewunmi Dynasty</h2>
    <p>
      The Okewunmi Dynasty is a family rooted in truth, sacrifice, faith, and legacy. At the heart of this great family is Elder Solomon Okewunmi, a man widely respected for his integrity, wisdom, and selfless devotion. Born and raised in Ogun State, Egba, Abeokuta—Itori Oke, Elder Solomon has lived his life as a shining example of what it means to serve both family and community with unwavering commitment.

    <p>
      Now at the age of 71 (in 2025), Elder Solomon continues to stand as a pillar of strength and guidance. He is known for his truthfulness, his sacrificial nature, and his uncommon dedication to the welfare of his children and grandchildren. Through his foresight and discipline, he ensured that his children received a solid foundation in education, equipping them to excel in life and contribute meaningfully to society.
    </p>
    <p>
      By his side is his beloved wife, Deaconess Adebola Okewunmi, a virtuous woman and nurturing mother of many. Hailing from Ita Morning in Abeokuta, she embodies grace, compassion, and deep spirituality. As a devoted wife, mother, and woman of faith, she has played a central role in building the strong moral and spiritual backbone of the family.

    <p>
      Together, Elder Solomon and Deaconess Adebola have established a home where love, respect, discipline, and godliness are deeply valued. The Okewunmi Dynasty is not just about bloodline, but about heritage, values, and impact—a family known for its resilience, unity, and strong connection to its roots.
